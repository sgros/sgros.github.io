# ITS-model-dataset

This repository contains sample models of IT systems. The folder structure is as follows. Top-level folders indicate the overall type of IT system, while the folders inside correspond to different variants of that type. Inside each of those, there are three additional folders, namely "inputs", "outputs", and "visualization", that respectively contain input files describing basic requirements of the IT system in question, generated model of an IT system for stated requirements, and an automatically generated visualization of the IT system. Each of the three folders contains several files for different problem sizes of the variant in question.
