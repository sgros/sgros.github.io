Welcome to my homepage. On these pages you'll find something about me and what I usually do. Note that these pages are mixed, in Croatian and in English. I do not have any intention (at least not for now) to keep two separate copies, it is too time consuming. The pages that are in Croatian will be marked as such by having italic item in a menu on the right. Also note that I'm still trying to figure out the exact layout of these pages, so things might (and will) change in the course of time.

### Very short CV
