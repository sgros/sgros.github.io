On this page you'll find services I can provide to companies and other research institutions.

## Research & Development

I'm offering several consulting services related to R&D activities. All the services are primarily within field of
cyber security and information security.

R&D is a very specific and important field in which, at least in Croatia, neither research institutions nor
companies are good at with a few exceptions. The reason is that this field combines research that is specialty
of research institutions with development that is specialty of companies.

#### Idea Development

If you are thinking about starting a new R&D project and you need someone to help you with steering your
thoughts while discussing what could be done, or you need help in identifying research topics or issues,
then I can help you. Some of the project ideas I helped to articulate are:

* creating a tool to train incident handlers,
* increasing security of application when deployed in cloud environment.

I'm currently working on some other ideas, too. But since they are still in the stage of idea I won't talk
about them for now.
